# Secret Holiday Exchange Pairing

This script pairs people together for a secret holiday exchange, ensuring that each person is paired with someone else exactly once, and they are not included in the pool again. It also ensures that no one is paired with themselves.

## Usage

1. Populate the 'people' list with names (strings) of participants.
2. Run the script, and it will output the pairs.

## Example

```python
people = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
Output: [("Alice", "David"), ("Bob", "Charlie")]
```

Note: The output pairs are randomized, and the example output may vary.
